## Why I got interested in creating this project?
I am myself is a basketball fan and I like to exercise 
and learn new basketball movements, however I 
quickly realized that it is extremely hard to 
keep track of the progress without writing it down or 
externalizing it in any other digital way. 
Therefore, I started using a combination of regular notes 
and Microsoft Excel. Although this combination of apps allowed me to 
achieve desired outcomes, I also realized that I've spent too much time
jumping around different apps and moving information about 
workouts from one app to another (also watching a lot of YouTube to learn 
new exercises). And thus, I came up with an idea that it would be extremely 
convenient to have an application that has all of these features 
in one place, which exactly what HoopEx Helper will help you with!
